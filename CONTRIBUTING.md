## Opening a Pull Request
We follow a pretty straight-forward process for managing our Code contributions. Here are the steps for opening a Pull Request to Oz:

>__1. Fork the repo (from Master branch)__

>__2. Make local changes (making sure to pull updates from Master as they happen)__

>__3. Open a new Pull Request in Github__

>__4. We'll review your PR on Github and may request changes__

>__5. Make your changes based on feedback and update your PR__

>__6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 as necessary__

>__7. Once all reviews and changes have been made your PR will get merged into Oz__

Before opening a Pull Request please follow these rules:

- Make sure your Pull Request is atomic (one feature or bug fix per PR).
- Make sure your Pull Request has a complete and useful description of the changes you have made.
- Make sure your code follows the [Style Guide](https://github.com/greenarrowdb/oz/wiki/Style-Guide).
- Make sure you can run the existing examples and add new examples if applicable.
