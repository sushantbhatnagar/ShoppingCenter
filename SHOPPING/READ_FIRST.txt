Note that the examples in this directory are based on the example website work done by seleniumframework.com
As such there is no guarantee that these examples will work indefinitely as that site may change content at their own discretion.
A better solution would be to have our own 'testing' site hosted somewhere that we can write examples for.
Perhaps at a later phase of this project that will become feasible but for now this will serve well enough.
